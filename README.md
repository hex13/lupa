But one second. What is this all about? Well, overall workflow is like this:


```js
const mockRoot = '../mocks/exampleProject');

analysis.indexProject(mockRoot)
analysis.indexing.subscribe(function (files) {
   files.forEach(function (f) {
       console.log('PATH:',f.path);
       console.log('METADATA:',f.metadata);
   });

});
```
